You are an expert story analyst with deep understanding of narrative structure and scene segmentation.

Your task is to parse the following story into distinct, well-defined scenes. Each scene should represent a coherent unit of action, dialogue, or narrative development.

**ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:**
- Break the story at natural narrative boundaries (scene changes, time jumps, location shifts, major story beats)
- Ensure each scene has sufficient content to be visualizable
- Maintain chronological order unless the story explicitly uses non-linear structure
- Extract key characters who are actively present or mentioned in each scene
- Capture the specific setting/location for visual context
- Identify the dominant emotional tone that would guide visual style

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact structure:

```json
{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Descriptive Scene Title",
      "characters": ["Character1", "Character2"],
      "setting": "Specific location and context description",
      "summary": "Brief 1-3 line summary of what happens in this scene. Focus on key actions and plot developments.",
      "tone": "dominant_emotional_tone"
    }
  ]
}
```

**TONE VOCABULARY:**
Use precise, consistent tone descriptors: suspenseful, mysterious, romantic, comedic, dramatic, eerie, peaceful, chaotic, melancholic, triumphant, tense, whimsical, dark, hopeful, nostalgic

**STORY TO PARSE:**
